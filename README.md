# 🍋 Little Lemon Restaurant – Final Project (Meta Back-End Developer Course)

This is my submission for the final assignment of the **Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate**.

## 📚 About the Course

Throughout the course, we learned to build modern web backend using:

- **Django** – for powerful and scalable web application development
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – for building RESTful APIs
- **Djoser** – for handling authentication endpoints out of the box (login, signup, password reset, etc.)

The course covered concepts like:
- Models and migrations
- Viewsets, serializers, permissions
- Token-based authentication
- API testing and integration with tools like **Insomnia** and **Postman**
- Connecting to **MySQL databases**
